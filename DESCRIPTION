Description: Learn how to use the MDGP-Scaling algorithm to scale categorical raster data. The tutorial introduces theory and methods of scaling and how to upscale categorical raster data, considering the scale factor and information retention of the scaled classes across the landscape. The MDGP-Scaling alogrithm is implemented in the R package landscapeScaling. In the second part of the tutorial the detection of scaled classes from remotely sensed data is evaluated.
