Description: Tutorial to explore the multi-dimensional grid-point (mdgp) scaling method and algorithm. The main functions are available in the R package "lndscapeScling". The MDGP-Scaling algorithm generates a new classification scheme on the basis of user desired class label precision of mixed classes and representativeness of the scaled class across the landscape of interest. The scaling output provides scaled categorical raster maps with mixed classes, a corresponding continuous raster with information retention calculations for each scaled grid cell and class-specific and landscape-scale mean and standard deviation of information retention.
