The purpose of this tutorial package is to introduce theoretical
concepts of scaling and the complexity of scaling categorical data. It
then introduces the multi-dimensional grid-point (MDGP) scaling method
and the algorithm as implemented in the R package landscapeScaling.
Guided exercises demonstrate the effects of user-defined parameters and
selection criteria on the definition of scale-appropriate classification
schemes that maximize information retention, representativeness of the
scaled classes and the detection probability from remotely sensed data.
The MDGP-Scaling algorithm generates new classification schemes on the
basis of user desired class label precision of mixed classes and their
representativeness across the landscape of interest. Part (1) of the
tutorial introduces theory and method to scaling of categorical raster
data. Part (2) of the tutorial evaluates the detection of the scaled
classes from remotely sensed data.

## Installation

The installation of the tutorial, includes the installation of the
newest version of the R package landscapeScaling and its dependencies.
Other required packages for this tutorial are BAMMtools and caret.
