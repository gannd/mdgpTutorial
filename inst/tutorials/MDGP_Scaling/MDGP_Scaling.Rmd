#### *The R package {landscapeScaling}*

The package {landscapeScaling} provides the methods and functions to upscale categorical raster data using the Multi-Dimensional Grid-Point scaling method by @Gann_2019. The method generates a new classification scheme on the basis of user desired class label precision of mixed classes and representativeness of the scaled classes across the landscape of interest. 

The scaling procedure creates scaled categorical raster maps with mixed classes, a corresponding continuous raster with compositional information retention calculations for each scaled grid cell, class-specific and landscape-level mean and standard deviation of information retention.The functions for MDGP-Scaling can be divided into two types of functions. The low-level functions follow a step-wise procedure of the scaling process. The high-level function 'mdgp_scale_raster' nests several functions to produce a scaled product from the raw categorical raster input. We will explore first the step-wise procedure before using the nested functions.

The current version of {landscapeScaling} was installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with devtools (devtools::install_github("gannd/landscapeScaling") during the installation of this tutorial.

**Check the working directory. This location will change every time you run the chunk -- try it. Therefore, we will have to set our working directory explicitly in every chunk where write data for subsequent exercises, and when we read the data.**

## Spatial Scale and Scaling 

Scale is a **property of the observer of a system** and is defined by **extent** and **grain** at which the system is **sampled** (the sampling rate). **Every model** includes scaling procedures and makes **assumptions**.

When we observe a system at different spatial scales and hierarchical levels different patterns emerge. Temporal analysis of system state changes rely on the tractability of spatial patterns so that they compare across space and time. Spatial scales of data vary over time and comparability is lost. With the ever increasing spatial and temporal resolution of remotely sensed data, the need for good scaling practices is increasing.

### Why Do We Need Spatial Scaling? 

To apply models that are informed by small-scale data at larger scales (larger extent and/or grain size) data samples (point or spatially exhaustive data) are scaled or aggregated. 

Many ecological models rely on information patterns of distribution and dynamics of *primary producers* (i.e plant species, communities, or morphological or functional types of vegetation). 

#### Earth System Models
Earth System Models (ESM) rely on remote sensing-derived products at various scales. The relationship between gross primary productivity (GPP) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) in the photosynthetically active wavelengths is a function of the amount of photosynthetically active biomass.
Amount of photosynthetically active biomass can be approximated by leaf area, the incident radiation intercepted by the active biomass, and the photosynthetic efficiency with which the fraction of absorbed PAR (fPAR) is converted into biomass. The two important biophysical variables, leaf area and fPAR, can be retrieved from spectral reflectance measurements of remotely sensed imagery. 

The most commonly used vegetation index to estimate fPAR is the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The MOD17 algorithm, for instance, relies on data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) @Running_1999, @Running_Zhao_2015 to estimate fPAR from NDVI.

Estimation of these variables from MODIS), which has high temporal resolution (daily) but coarse spatial resolution (500 m), relies on land-cover knowledge of each pixel @Steltzer_Welker_2006; @Zhao_2016.

LAI and fPAR are sensitive to land-cover information @Lotsch_2003, and the heterogeneity of vegetation types within a pixel affects LAI estimates in a nonlinear fashion @Garrigues_2006.

Therefore, knowing proportions or fractions of land cover is useful for modeling LAI. The lack of knowledge about mixed-pixel composition arises from coarse classification schemes or aggregation of detailed maps with algorithms that do not modify the classification scheme to accommodate mixed pixels (e.g., majority rule) at the scale of modeling the biophysical variable. 

#### Land Cover Distribution and Transition Models
Ecotone expansion rate relative to resolution of sensor or data model (example: patch expansion and contraction).

#### Species Distribution Model 
Multi-scale species habitat models. At larger spatial scales mixed habitat presence might be of importance (example: bird habitat includes different habitat types for foraging, roosting and nesting; mix of open and closed forest habitat, or mixes of tree species with specialist characteristic for foraging).

### Summary

When modeling ecological processes the scale of analysis needs to be supported by scale and precision of the data that are used in the model. For spatial modeling we often need to scale spatially exhaustive data sets to match the scale of analysis. 
\t

## Spatial Data Scaling (Aggregation)

### The Problem
Complexity of spatial data scaling is low when the system (e.g., landscape) is homogeneous across space. As heterogeneity of the system increases and processes become more spatially dependent, scaling becomes more challenging.

For **continuous data** we have several statistical methods that allow us to scale or aggregate data to match the scale of analysis using mathematical and statistical methods that include 

- statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, median, etc.)
- interpolation (e.g., inverse distance weighted, spline)
- geostatistics (e.g., kriging).

In the case of **categorical data** existing values in the raw data replace the scaled or aggregated unit, regardless of scale factor. The most common methods for categorical data are

- **majority** or **plurality**
- **nearest neighbor**
- **random** selection

These decision rules  oversimplify the patterns that are driven by processes at different spatial scales, homogenizing the landscape with a huge, often not quantified loss of information.

### The Majority or Plurality Rule

The majority rule, in most cases actually a plurality rule, replaces the label of the most common or abundant 'class' or 'category' of a set to the aggregated objects even of no majority is reached. In the case of spatial aggregation of a landscape the class label that is most abundant for the *n* replaced units. 

The scale factors determines how many grid cells get aggregated. If a square kernel with equal weights for each cells is used, the number of cells that are aggregated and replaced with one new cell is $n_{replaced} = sf^2$.  

For example, for a scale factor of three, nine cells are aggregated and the label of the most abundant class of the nine labels is assigned. In the case of nearest-neighbor method the class label of the cell closest to the output grid cell is assigned.

</center>

**Assumptions of the plurality rule are:**

- the original classes (labels) are valid at the aggregated scale regardless of scale factor
- the loss of compositional information in the scaled data is negligible for the model they will be used in

**Describe examples and conditions where these assumptions are problematic.**

### Compositional Information Retention

Information retention can be defined in many different ways. Here we simply define compositional information retention when aggregating high-resolution data to a lower resolution with the Czekanowski Index:

$$IR_{c} = \sum_{i-1}^{N} min(P_{i}smp, P_{i}scaled)$$ 
$IR_{c}$ is the compositional information retention; $P_{i}smp$ is the proportion of class $i$ of the high-resolution grid within the scaled grid cell, and $P_{i}scaled$ is the proportion of class $i$ retained in the scaled grid cell label. 

Applying the equation to each scaled grid cell in the previous example we obtain loss of information for majority- and nearest-neighbor rule aggregation at the cell-level.  and are demonstrated for a small subset of a 9 x 9 grid cell landscape aggregated with a scale factor of 3 and 9.  

<center>
![*Compositional information retention $IR_{c}$ the cell-level when upscaling categorical data while maintaining the high-resolution classification scheme. For the example landscape, aggregation with the majority rule and nearest-neighbor rule at a scale factor of 3 and 9 retains at most 55.5% of compositional information in any of the cells with minimum retention dropping as low as 11.1% for the nearest-neighbor method when the nearest neighbor only represents 1 of the nine original cells. Mean $IR_{c}$ for the landscape-level is 46.9% for plurality rule and 33% for nearest-neighbor. For a scale factor of 9, landscape-level $IR_{c}$ for plurality rule is 45.7% and for the nearest-neighbor rule only 25.9%. Adapted from @Gann_Richards_2022.*](images/Fig_SF_3_9.png){ width=75% }

### Exercise 1: Quantify Information Retention

Objective: The first exercise will explore the effects of landscape characteristics and scale factor on information loss. 

To explore and demonstrate the complexity of categorical data scaling and the effects of the plurality rule on information loss we will quantify compositional information retention when scaling landscapes with different properties and for different scale factors.

**Procedure:**

- generate a small landscape with a pre-defined number of categories (richness) and with different levels of spatial heterogeneity
- generate a scaling grid for a specified scale factor to delineate spatial aggregation units 
- assign labels to the scaled grids on the basis of the plurality rule and calculate compositional information retention at the cell level and at the landscape level

To generate the landscapes we will use an R package that generates neutral landscapes with known properties. The package is called Neutral Landscape Models for R (NLMR) https://ropensci.github.io/NLMR/. To categorize the landscapes we will use the classify function from the 'terra' package, generating the class breaks using the Jenks method as implemented in the 'BAMMtools' package.

We will then manually apply the plurality rule that does not modify the classification scheme but only uses original class labels for the spatially aggregated geographic units.

For plotting purpose a color scheme that is used for all plotting has been set up. The color scheme is a color-blind safe choice (Paul Ton  https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:qualitative)

```{r, show-color-scheme, eval=TRUE}
print('Color Scheme')
scales::show_col(col12)
```

----

We will first explore landscape characteristics for random landscape patterns. We will vary the number of classes (c), the roughness parameter (r), and the number of columns and rows (n) that control the size of the landscape. For simplicity, the random landscapes will have equal numbers of rows and columns.

We will generate a grid that scales the original maps with a scale factor (sf). This means that each block of *sf* by *sf* cells will be replaced by an aggregated cell. The grid is generated with a function of the {sf} package and plotted on top of the landscape. For simplicity we will use an odd scale factor. 

Start with the default parameter settings, executing the code by clicking hte Run button. 

```{r, nlm-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=42, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## generate a landscape with 'n' by 'n' cells and 'c' classes.
## spatial aggregation is controlled by the roughness parameter 'r'

# landscape characteristics
n <- 10   # number of rows and columns: 1 more than cells per row and column!
c <- 5   # number of classes: 2 more than classes ; first break point 0 and last break point 1 are not included
r <- 0.04   # roughness

# scaling parameters
sf <- 3   # set the scale factor

# ======= DO NOT MODIFY BEYOND THIS LINE =======

# generate the landscape and convert to SpatRaster object.
nlm <- terra::rast(NLMR::nlm_mpd(ncol = n, nrow = n, roughness = r))

# classify the midpoint-displacement generated grid into x categorical classes
nlm_cat <- terra::classify(nlm, rcl=BAMMtools::getJenksBreaks(terra::values(nlm), c))    

# assign class names to the three raster values 
levels(nlm_cat) <- data.frame(value=c(1:c),lc=c(LETTERS[1:c])) 
# -----------------------------------------------
# plot the categorized landscape
x11();terra::plot(nlm_cat,col=col12,mar=c(1.5,1.5,1.5,8),
            main=paste0((n-1)^2,' Cell Landscape of ',c-2,' Classes and Roughness ',r),
            cex.main = 1.2,
            plg=list(title = 'Class Names',
            title.cex = 1, cex = 1),
            pax=list(cex.axis = 1 ))

# generate a grid for scale factor 
g.sf  <- sf::st_make_grid(nlm_cat, square=TRUE, cellsize = floor((n-1)/sf))

# plot the grid
plot(g.sf,add=T,col='transparent',border='black',lwd=2)
```
We will now explore the effects of the roughness parameter (r) on the landscape pattern with three classes. Then increase the number of classes (c), and/or the size of the landscapes (n) and re-run the code with different roughness levels. Every execution generates a new map that can be compared to the previous ones.

**Describe the effect of parameters class number and roughness on the heterogeneity of the landscape.** 
```{r, roughness-problem, exercise=TRUE}
print('Answer: ')
```

Now vary the scale factor parameter. To be able to use larger scale factors increase (n) to 40,  

**How does the scale factor (sf) related to the number of pixels that will be replaced by a single pixel in the scaled landscape** 
```{r, scale-factor-problem, exercise=TRUE}
print('Answer: ')
```
close all plot windows and complete **Problem 1**.

**Problem 1:** Quantify the effects of landscape heterogeneity on class percent differences between original and scaled landscape and on compositional information retention.

- Generate two landscapes with 81 grid cells and 3 classes. One landscape has a roughness of .01, the other .95.
- Scale the landscapes with scale factor 3.
- Calculate percent differences between original and scaled landscape for both landscapes.
- Calculate cell-level and landscape level information retention.

plot(g.sf,add=T,col='transparent',border='black',lwd=2)

print('ADD THE PROPORTION VALUES IN THE CORRESPONDING VECTOR IN THE NEXT CHUNK BEOFRE RUNNING THE NEXT ITERATION!')
```

After each run, transfer the proportional cover of each class to the "nlm_r.[xx]_cls.prp". 

Determine the scaled class label for each of the nine scaled grid cells using the plurality rule. Add the classes to the vectors "nlm_r.[xx]_scl3.cls" for the corresponding landscapes.

Add syntax to calculate class percentages for each scaled landscape and percent class differences for the scaled landscape in relation to the original class distributions.

```{r problem-1-scale, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=20, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

nlm_r.95_cls.prp <- data.frame(class=c('A','B','C'),prp=c(x,x,x))

# using the majority rule, determine the class for each scaled 3x3 cell and add the class labels for each of the two landscapes to each of the class vectors. 
nlm_r.01_scl3.cls <- c('X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X','X')

print(x.95)

```

Calculate the cell-specific information retention for both landscapes using the Czekanowski Index and add the numbers for each of the nine grid cells of each landscape to the vectors 'nlm1_ir' and 'nlm1_ir' in the next R chunk. Once both vectors are complete run the chunk to calculate mean IR for each landscape. $$IR_{c} = \sum_{i-1}^{N} min(P_{i}smp, P_{i}scaled)$$ 
$IR_{c}$ is the compositional information retention; $P_{i}smp$ is the proportion of class $i$ of the high-resolution grid within the scaled grid cell, and $P_{i}scaled$ is the proportion of class $i$ retained in the scaled grid cell label.

```{r, nlm-ir, eval=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}

## Introduction to MDGP-Scaling
### The Scaling Method
The MDGP-Scaling Algorithm has been developed to allow for more precise data aggregation of categorical data.

* It does not assume that the original classification scheme is valid at the aggregated scale
* It allows the user to define the precision of mixed class labels
* It allows for controlling representativeness of classes across the landscape
* It provides quantitative assessment of compositional information retention (loss) at the cell level and at the landscape level.

The concepts of phytosociology inspired the development of the MDGP-Scaling algorithm. Classification of plant communities on the basis of quantitative abundance or cover data and their analytical methods is common in vegetation ecology and phytosociology. 

Quantitative methods for vegetation classification go back to Braun_Blanquet_1964. More recent developments in the field identified criteria of a good vegetation classification system:

* representative (three aspects)
* reproducible

What do each of these terms mean?
```{r, questions-1-2-response, eval=FALSE, exercise=TRUE}

### MDGP-Scaling Algorithm

The MDGP-Scaling algorithm aggregates categorical data while simultaneously generating a non-hierarchical, representative classification system for the aggregated spatial scale similar to the concepts of Phytosociology. 
The scaled data consistently preserve information at a significantly higher rate than other aggregation algorithms that do not account for classification scheme dependence.

#### The Parameters

The four parameters that determine the classes of the scaled classification scheme are: 

**Precision**

* $parts$ relates to the scaled class-label precision of mixed classes. It also controls for local and landscape level information loss

**Representativeness**

Representativeness is evaluated at three different levels 

At the landscape level:
* $rpr-threshold$ determines the minimum percent presence of a scaled class across the landscape (study area). Classes that are below the threshold are merged with classes that maximize information retention. The only classes exluded are the monotypic classes tha tcan be present at lower percentages.

At the class level:
* $monotypic-threshold$ determines the threshold for class abundance to be considered a monotypic class and to be retained in the final classification scheme even when present at less than the representativeness threshold across the landscape

At the cell level:
* $ir-threshold$ determines the threshold for information retention at the cell-level. If a cell has an information retention below this threshold the cell is assinged the class 'ZZZ_Other' (to assure the class is last in the alphabetic listing it has the prefix ZZZ_). 


----

The larger the parameter **$parts$**, the more classes will be generated, increasing the precision of class-label components in the scaled class labels. 
The number of potential classes is determined by the richness of the original raster, and the precision parameter $parts$ (setting $parts$ to 1 (precision = 100%) is equal to the most commonly used alternative method of plurality rule).

As precision increases, the number of potential **multi-dimensional grid points** increases (black dots). As richness of the original landscape increases the dimensionality of the multi-dimensional grid points increases (blue box: richness = 4).

<center>
![*Multi-dimensional grid points generated for class-label precisions ranging from 100% (parts = 1) to 20% (parts = 5). As richness of the original landscape increases (blue box: richness = 4) the dimensionality of the multi-dimensional grid points increases. Adopted from @Gann_2019.*](images/Fig-MDGP.png){ width=75% }

Three Class Example: Scaling the small three class example landscape with a scale factor of 9 (all 81 grid cells are replaced by 1 scaled grid cell). 

For each precision level, the scaled cell assigned to the grid point that maximizes $IR_{c}$. Comparison across all solutions indicates the maximum information retained for the given precision level.

![*Multi-dimensional grid points generated for label precisions ranging from 100% (parts = 1) to 25% (parts = 4) (top to bottom). Richness of the original 81 cell landscape is three (classes a,b and c). The scaled class label list for each precision level (LabelList) is the enumerated list of all grid points. The solution that maximizes categorical information retention $IR_{c}$ for each grid-point solution is emphasized in bold. The last column summarizes the grid-point information the grid cell is assigned. Maximum $IR_{c}$ increases with precision. Adapted from @Gann_Richards_2022.*](images/Fig_SF_5_ir.png){ width=100% }

----

#### Scaling Entire Landscapes

Scaling entire landscapes using MDGP-Scaling generates frequency distributions of mixed classes. Number of classes and definitions depend on:

* landscape properties (richness, diversity, and spatial aggregation)
* scaling parameters (scale factor, label precision, and representativeness)

----

Example: A neutral landscape with 3 classes A,B and C that have a geometric class distribution and a spatial aggregation of 0 (generated with the mid-point displacement algorithm @NLMR). Applying a **scale factor 5** and varying precision levels from **100%**, **33.3%**, and **20%** results in the following class distributions:   
<center>
![*Landscape scaled with scale factor 5 and class label precisions of 100% (parts=1), 33,3% (parts=3) and 20% (parts=5). Circle size displays absolute scale of class proportions (Prop_AS) across all plots; colour rendered as relative scale of class proportions (Prop_RS) within each plot. Small black dots in the terneray plots indicate that the potential grid point was not realized at the aggregated scale. Class labels are composed of class name and nominal percent representativeness. Adopted from @Gann_2019.*](images/Fig-LS-SF5.png){ width=65% }
</center>


Scaling the same landscape with **scale factor 15** and the same precision levels of **100%**, **33.3%**, and **20%** leads to very different class distributions.

### Exercise 2: MDGP-Scaling - Plurality Rule

Objective: Compare the effects of scale factor on information retention.

We will first generate the landscape that will then be scaled with scale factors 3 and 5. The scling result will then be converted to rasters of scaled classes and their associated cell-level $IR_{c}$.

# write the landscape to file so it can be used in the next exercise (not in memory!)
terra::writeRaster(nlm_cat,paste0('./nlm_',n-1,'.tif'),overwrite=TRUE)
```

The landscape was written to the working directory folder as a ".tif" file. It will be loaded in all subsequent chunks.

----

(2) Scale the landscape with scale factors 3 and 5.

- Calculate the relative abundance of original classes for a specific scale factor using the ‘relative_abundance_scaled_grid’ function. First, the lower left corner of each of the scaled grid cells is generated, followed by the tabulation of relative abundance of the high-resolution classes within each scaled grid cell

  - The x and y coordinates of the lower left corner for each scaled grid cell and the relative abundance for each cell are returned as data frame

  - Potential MDGPs are generated using the class label precision parameter $parts$ and the landscape richness (number of classes) 

- Using the 'mdgp_scale' function, each cell is classified (assigned) to the MDGP that maximizes $IR_{c}$ . 

  - The 'mdgp_scale' function requires arguments $parts$ for the class label precision, the representativeness threshold $prp-threshold$, and the monotypic class threshold $monotypic-threshold$. We will keep not restrict the representativeness or use monotypic class threshold for now.

For each scaled grid cell, the function returns the original class abundances, the lower left corner coordinate (x_y), the scaled class label and the corresponding $IR_{c}$. The function returns a data frame.

```{r, nlm-classify, exercise=TRUE, eval=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# set working directory
setwd('')

# read the landscape
map <- terra::rast('./nlm_[X].tif')   # replace X with the resolution of the map to be used
classField <- 'lc'

# set the precision parameter parts
prts <- 1 

# set the scale factor
sf <- 3

# out file name prefix
prfx <- 'nlm_30' 

# ======= DO NOT MODIFY BEYOND THIS LINE =======

# calculate the relative abundance
rel_abund <- landscapeScaling::relative_abundance_scaled_grid(map,class_field=classField,scale_factor=sf)

# write relative abundance to file
write.csv(rel_abund,file=paste0('./',prfx,'_sf',sf,'_rel_abund.csv'))

# classify relative abundance samples to multi-dimensional grid points with no restrictions on the representativeness threshold, monotypic class threshold, and the default information retention threshold of 1%
mdgp_result <- landscapeScaling::mdgp_scale(rel_abund,parts=prts,rpr_threshold=0,monotypic_threshold=100,ir_threshold=1)

# write the scaled data frame to .rds file
saveRDS(mdgp_result,file=paste0('./',prfx,'_sf',sf,'_prts',prts,'.rds'))
```

----

(3) Convert the classified points and the corresponding location-specific information retention to raster. 

A list with three objects is returned:

- the rasterized classified cells
- the rasterized compositional information retention
- a list with two objects
  + the class-specific mean and standard deviation of information retention as a data frame
  + the landscape scale aggregated mean and standard deviation as a list

We will first load the saved results from the previous chunk output. Replace the X.rds with the name of the mdgp_results you want to convert to raster.

The function to convert scaling results to raster is 'scaling_result_to_raster'. function.

```{r, nlm3-mdgp-to-raster, exercise=TRUE, eval=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# set working directory
setwd('')

# read the scaling results object
mdgp_result <- readRDS('./X.rds') # replace X.rds with the name of the scaling results file

# set the precision parameter parts
prts <- 1

# set the scale factor
sf <- 3

# ======= DO NOT MODIFY BEYOND THIS LINE =======

# convert classified points and location-specific information retention to raster
mdgp_raster <- landscapeScaling::scaling_result_to_raster(mdgp_result,class_name_field='class_name',scale_factor=sf)

# plot the scaled map
x11();terra::plot(mdgp_raster[[1]],col=col12,mar=c(1.5,1.5,1.5,8),
            main=paste0('Scaled Classes: Parts=',prts,'; SF=',sf),cex.main = 1.2,
            plg=list(title = "Class Names",title.cex = 1, cex = 1),
            pax=list(cex.axis = 1 ))

# plot information retention of the scaled map
x11();terra::plot(mdgp_raster[[2]],col=gray.colors(20,start=0.1,end=1),mar=c(1.5,1.5,1.7,8),
            main=paste0('Information Retention: Parts=',prts,'; SF=',sf),cex.main = 1.2,
            plg=list( title = "IR %",title.cex = 1, cex = 1),
            pax=list(cex.axis = 1 ))

# print the class-specific and landscape scale summary statistics 
print(mdgp_raster[[3]])
```

### Exercise 3: MDGP-Scaling - Class-Label Precision and Representativness Threshold

We will now explore the effects of MDGP-Scaling parameters 'parts' and 'rpr_threshold' and compare information retention and class number.

Modify one parameter at a time, with settings for 'parts' ranging between 1 and 9 and landscape representativeness between 0% and 20%.  

Explore different combinations of settings.

```{r, nlm3-mdgp-explore, exercise=TRUE, eval=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# set working directory
setwd('')

# read relative abundance table from file
rel_abund <- read.csv('./X.csv')

# set parts between 2 and 5 corresponding to 50% up to 20% class label proportion (precision)
prts <- 2

# scale factor
sf <- 3
  
# set representativeness, monotypic class, and cell-level information  retention thresholds 
rpr_th <- 0
mono_th <- 100
ir_th <- 50
# ======= DO NOT MODIFY BEYOND THIS LINE =======

mdgp_result <- mdgp_scale(rel_abund,parts=prts,rpr_threshold=rpr_th,monotypic_threshold=mono_th,ir_threshold=ir_th)
print(mdgp_result)
# -----------------------------------------------
# convert classified points and location-specific information retention to raster
mdgp_raster <- landscapeScaling::scaling_result_to_raster(mdgp_result,class_name_field='class_name',scale_factor=sf)
# -----------------------------------------------
# plot the scaled map
x11();terra::plot(mdgp_raster[[1]],col=col12,mar=c(1.5,1.5,1.5,8),
            main=paste0('Scaled Classes for ',prts,' parts'),cex.main = 1.2,
            plg=list( title = "Class Name",title.cex = 1, cex = 1),
            pax=list(cex.axis = 1 ))

# plot information retention of the scaled map
x11();terra::plot(mdgp_raster[[2]],col=gray.colors(20,start=0.1,end=1),mar=c(1.5,1.5,1.7,8),
            main=paste0('Information Retention for ',prts,' parts'),cex.main = 1.2,
            plg=list( title = "IR %",title.cex = 1, cex = 1),
            pax=list(cex.axis = 1 ))
# -----------------------------------------------
# print the class-specific and landscape scale summary statistics 
print(mdgp_raster[[3]])
